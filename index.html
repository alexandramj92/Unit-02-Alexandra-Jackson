        <p>My educational background consists of a BA
            in French litterature from UCLA and a Masters in Sustnainable Development from the French business school, HEC Paris. I have always wanted to contribute to solving the greatest threat to hummanity as we know it: Climate Change.

            <p> Additionally, I love using my free time to expand on some of my other skills. I have been riding horses since I was 7 years old and will ride every couple of months and while I am traveling as I find that it is an excellent way of sightseeing. I will also practice yoga about twice a week which I find extremely rewarding both physically and mentally. </p>
